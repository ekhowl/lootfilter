# Ekhowl's loot filter

Loot filter (or enhancer/notifier, rather) for Path of Exile: The Awakening.

My starting point was ZiggyD's awesome loot filter (thank you for a solid base to start working from!), which I modified to my own liking. The loot isn't actually filtered away, stuff you don't really care about have a smaller font and no background whereas important items show and stand out. Flasks and gems with any quality are highlighted, the very high-end currency has a sound alert played when they drop etc.

Copy this file to $\My Documents\My Games\Path of Exile\

And you're good to go. :-) Remember to select the filter from the Settings -> UI.
