# Ekhowl's loot filter

Loot filter for Path of Exile: The Awakening.

My starting point was ZiggyD's awesome loot filter (thank you for a solid base to start working from!), which I modified to my own liking. Flasks and gems with any quality are highlighted, mid and high-end currency has a sound alert when they drop etc.

Copy this file to $USERNAME\Documents\My Games\Path of Exile\

And you're good to go. :-) Remember to load the filter from the Settings -> UI.
